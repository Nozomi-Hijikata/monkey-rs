# monkey-rs

This is a simple implementation of the monkey programming language in Rust.
The monkey programming language is a simple language that is used in the book ["Writing an Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.

This project uses [lalrpop](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop) to implement the lexer and parser.
